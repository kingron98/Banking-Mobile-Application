This is a banking application. The application allows user to check their balance. The balance gets displayed
accordingly to the GPS location the user is at. But it is limited to only Ireland, United States and United
Kingdom. So euros, dollars and pounds respectively. The balance is also shown according to the currency 
symbol. If the countries are outside of the 3 specified, it will be displayed at dollars. User can also 
update their profile, such as their phone number and email. This will require the user to type in their 
password again to confirm the changes. If the password is valid, then the changes will be made. The application 
also lets user transfer funds. The funds are transferred in dollars. This is because the data is stored as dollars
balance in the database. It will check for sufficient funds or valid bank account before proceeding to make the
transfer. Lastly the application also allows user to check the transactions made. This screen will display
a screen of transactions to the user. The sender name, recipient name and amount will be shown. If the account
is the recipient, the amount will be shown together with a positive sign stating increase in balance. If it's
the sender account, then it does the opposite. 

If i had more time, i will include a current and savings account for a user. Because in the real world, that is
how most bank accounts are. I will also make the application highly available worldwide. So the balance and 
symbol displays accordingly to any countries. I also will add this feature to transfer funds so user can
transfer in their own currency. If it is possible, i would add the function like AIB to check balance. The
user bank account is binded to the device. The user will not have to login to their bank account everytime
when using the application to check balance, there will be a button for the user to press and hold to quickly 
see their available balance in their account.
